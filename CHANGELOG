PyNDN v2.1beta1 (2015-09-24)
----------------------------

Changes
* In security, added KeyChain.createIdentityAndCertificate which returns the
  certificate name, instead of the deprecated createIdentity which returns the
  key name.
* Added AsyncTcpTransport and AsyncUnixTransport which use asyncio and do not
  require the application to call processEvents.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/3005 In Face.registerPrefix, added the
  optional onRegisterSuccess callback.
* In ThreadsafeFace, for the constructors ThreadsafeFace(loop) and
  ThreadsafeFace(loop, host, port) use AsyncTcpTransport or AsyncUnixTransport
  which do not require the application to call processEvents.
* In ThreadsafeFace, remove support for stopWhen() since this requires a
  processEvents loop which we want to avoid when using asyncio. The application
  must stop the asyncio loop - see examples/test_get_async_threadsafe.py .
* In ThreadsafeFace, do not automatically run a processEvents loop since the
  default AsyncTcpTransport and AsyncUnixTransport don't need it. (If your
  application uses a different transport which does not use the asyncio loop,
  then it needs to run a processEvents loop.)
* In ThreadsafeFace, don't automatically import it into the pyndn module since
  asyncio is optional. To explicitly import it, use:
  from pyndn.threadsafe_face import ThreadsafeFace
* In security ConfigPolicyManager, added load(input, inputName) to read
  configuration rules from a string.
* In integration_tests, added test_registration_callbacks.
* In Face.registerPrefix, removed deprecated support to register with NDNx.
* In Interest, removed deprecated NDNx get/setScope.
* In ForwardingFlags, removed deprecated NDNx flags active, advertise, last,
  local, tap and captureOK.
* Removed deprecated NDNx ForwardingEntry.
* Removed deprecated NDNx support for binary XML packets.
* In WireFormat, removed ENABLE_NDNX since all NDNx support is now removed.

Deprecated
* Deprecated KeyChain.createIdentity. Use createIdentityAndCertificate which
  returns the certificate name instead of the key name.
* In Interest, deprecated get/setScope since it is for NDNx and NFD does not use it.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2846 Self-signed cert name needs a version component.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2847 Lower-case "ksk-" in generated key name.

PyNDN v2.0beta4 (2015-05-13)
----------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2624 By default, throw an exception when
  using the deprecated NDNx and binary XML wire format. To enable support while
  you upgrade your code to use NFD, in your main application set
  WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX = True
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1921 In Face, added getMaxNdnPacketSize().
  expressInterest and putData throw an exception if the encoded size exceeds it.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2566 In Face, added setInterestFilter. In
  registerPrefix, make the onInterest callback optional.
* Face: In registerPrefix, changed the onInterest callback to pass interestFilterId
  instead of registeredPrefixId.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2579 In registerPrefix and setInterestFilter,
  support the onInterest callback form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter).
  The new callback form is passed the Face instead of Transport so that you can
  supply the Data with face.putData(). It also takes the InterestFilter supplied
  to setInterestFilter.
* MemoryContentCache: In registerPrefix, changed the onDataNotFound callback to call
  onDataNotFound(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter).
  If your application uses onDataNotFound, you must update your callback function.
* In Interest setter methods, return this so that you can chain calls to update values.
* Added class util/SegmentFetcher, ported from ndn-cxx. Use it in examples test_list_rib.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2532#change-8836 In Face.registerPrefix,
  if connected to a remote NFD then use localhop to do remote registration. (For
  remote registration, the remote NFD must be configured for localhop_security.)
  Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local.
* In MemoryContentCache, added support for storePendingInterest. add(data) will
  check if the added Data packet satisfies any pending interest. You can use
  getStorePendingInterest() for onDataNotFound in registerPrefix().
* Make Blob.__str__ return "" instead of None if the blob isNull().
* In ControlParameters, added support for Uri and Strategy.
* In the default WireFormat, implemented decodeControlParameters.
* Moved tests which need NFD from tests/unit_tests to tests/integration_tests.
* examples: Added test_list_channels, test_list_faces, test_list_rib and
  test_register_route to query NFD.
* examples: In repo_ng added basic_insertion.py and watched_insertion.py to
  show interaction with the repo-ng repository.
* examples: Removed test_encode_decode_forwarding_entry and
  test_publish_async_ndnx because NDNx support is deprecated.
* Unit tests: In test_interest_methods, added test_exclude_matches.

Deprecated
* Deprecated support for NDNx and binary XML. See WireFormat.ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Face, deprecated registerPrefix where the onInterest callback has the form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, transport, interestFilterId). Use the
  registerPrefix where onInterest has the form
  onInterest(prefix, interest, face, interestFilterId, filter) so you can call
  face.putData().

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2478 Fix ProtobufTlv for Python 3.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2544 Fix test_chrono_chat bug affecting OS X 10.10.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2758 ControlParameters with empty name not properly encoded.

PyNDN v2.0beta3 (2015-02-03)
----------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2388 Moved example programs from "tests" to "examples".
* In KeyChain.createIdentity, added an optional KeyParams argument.
* Unit tests: Added test-der-encode-decode tests for CertificateExtension.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2472 Fixes to support Python 3

PyNDN v2.0beta2 (2014-12-23)
----------------------------

Changes
* Support getter and setter properties in the classes Interest, Data, MetaInfo,
  KeyLocator and ForwardingFlags, plus the internal ForwardingEntry and
  ControlParameters.
* In Name, support slice notation to call getSubName, e.g. name[2:4].
* Added ChronoSync2013 and test_chrono_chat.py.
* In Name, added wireEncode and wireDecode.
* In MetaInfo, added get/setFinalBlockId (replaces the deprecated get/setFinalBlockID).
* In MemoryContentCache, added unregisterAll.
* Added ConfigPolicyManager for heirarchical verification using an NDN config file. (Thanks to Adeola Bannis.)
* Added DigestSha256Signature. Support encoding/decoding it in interests and data packets.
* In KeyChain, added signWithSha256.
* In registerPrefix, use logging.info to log success or the reason for failure.
* In each __init__.py, added import statements for each module (required by pylint).
* In unit tests, added test_name_conventions, test-policy_manager and test_verification_rules.
* Unit tests: In test-data-methods, added VerifyDigestSha256.
* Unit tests: In test-interest-methods, added VerifyDigestSha256.

Deprecated
* In MetaInfo, deprecated get/setFinalBlockID. Use get/setFinalBlockId.

PyNDN v2.0beta1 (2014-08-31)
----------------------------

Changes
* In Name.appendSegment and appendVersion, encode the number as nonNegativeInteger which is always 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
  This means that appendSegment(0) now encodes as %00%00 instead of just %00.
* In Name, added appendSegmentOffset, appendTimestamp and appendSequenceNumber.
* In Name.Component, added toSegmentOffset, toTimestamp and toSequenceNumber.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1925 Should encode non-negative integers 253 through 255 as one byte.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1955 Return the registeredPrefixId from registerPrefix.
